Beanstalkd vs Gearman: What are the differences?

    ## Key Differences Between Beanstalkd and Gearman

    1. **Functionality**:

        Beanstalkd is a simple, fast work queue
            whereas Gearman is a distributed job queuing system.

        Beanstalkd focuses on providing a straightforward queuing mechanism,
            while Gearman allows for more complex distributed job processing scenarios.

    2. **Protocol Support**:

        Beanstalkd uses its own binary TCP protocol, making it lightweight and fast,
            while Gearman supports multiple protocols like TCP, UDP, and SSL. This difference affects the compatibility and flexibility of the two systems in various network environments.

    3. **Job Dependencies**:

        Beanstalkd does not provide native support for job dependencies, meaning jobs cannot be set to run based on the completion of other jobs.
            On the other hand, Gearman allows for job dependencies, enabling more intricate job workflows and processing logic.

    4. **Ease of Use**:

        Beanstalkd is known for its simplicity and ease of use with a minimalistic feature set, making it ideal for straightforward queuing tasks.
            Gearman, being more feature-rich and complex, may require more time and effort to set up and configure for advanced job processing needs.

    5. **Community Support**:

        Gearman, being around longer and having a larger user base, has more extensive community support, documentation, and plugins available compared to Beanstalkd. This can be a significant factor to consider when choosing between the two systems.

    6. **Scalability**:

        While both Beanstalkd and Gearman support horizontal scalability by adding more servers,
            Gearman's distributed nature allows for easier scaling across multiple machines and clusters. This scalability aspect can be crucial for applications with high processing demands.

    In Summary, Beanstalkd and Gearman offer distinct functionalities and features, such as simplicity vs. complexity, protocol support, job dependencies, ease of use, community support, and scalability.

Comparing Beanstalkd, IronMQ and Amazon SQS
    https://www.sitepoint.com/message-queues-comparing-beanstalkd-ironmq-amazon-sqs/


    Glossary

        When working with queues you may come across these terms:

            Bury (a job) – puts a job in a failed state. The job cannot be reprocessed until it is manually kicked back into the queue. Not supported by IronMQ and SQS.

            Consumer – see Worker.

            Delay – defer a job from being sent to a worker for a predetermined amount of time.

            Delete (a job) – see Dequeue.

            Dequeue – marks a job as completed and removes it from the queue.

            Enqueue – adds a job to a queue ready for a worker.

            FIFO – describes the way jobs are handled in a queue as First In, First Out. This is the most common type of message queue.

            FILO – describes the way jobs are handled in a queue as First In, Last Out.

            Job – a deferred task in a queue containing metadata to identify what task is waiting to be processed. Akin to database rows.

            Kick (a job) – returns a previously buried job to the queue ready for workers to pick up. Not supported by IronMQ and SQS.

            Provider – a client which connects to the message server to create jobs.

            Queue – a way to group similar jobs into a queue. Akin to database tables.

            Reserve (a job) – delivers a job to a worker and locks it from being delivered to another worker.

            Worker – a client which connects to the message server to reserve, delete and bury jobs. These perform the labour intensive part of the processing.

    Terminology

        Some words are used differently between Beanstalkd and Amazon SQS. There’s a quick list of translations:

            Beanstalkd 	        Amazon SQS 	                IronMQ
            Tube 	            Queue 	                    Queue
            Job 	            Message 	                Message
            Job data 	        Message body 	            Message body
            Put 	            Send message 	            POST
            Reserve 	        Receive message 	        GET
            Delete 	            Delete message 	            DELETE
            TTR (time-to-run)   Visibility timeout          Timeout
            Delay 	            Delivery delay 	            Delay
            – 	                Retention Period 	        Expires in
